A personal finance calculator that is made to convert the prices of everyday items to the currency of "time-spent-at-work". This simple calculation greatly helped me to get on top of my unnecessary spending habits. While I used to be happy to spend 5â‚¬ on a Cappuchino, I'm much less inclined to waste the equivalent of 30 minutes of work on an impulse purchase like that.

Currently the UI is in german only.

Planned features for future releases:

English version UI
A "detailed" version taking into account things such as yearly bonus payments or time spent commuting to and from work.
A reference gallery of example items and their corresponding prices in "working hours" according to user's salary
Suggestions for additional features are welcome
I just started learning how to code, so I especially welcome feedback on the structure and readability of my code.

NOTE: The website for this project makes use of grid.css, which is a third-party CSS-grid by Jonas Schmedtmann. Since I'm new to github I am unsure how to properly give credit to third-party content - Please let me know if I'm violating any community-guidelines by incorporating code written by others.
